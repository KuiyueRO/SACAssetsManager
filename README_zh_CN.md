## Usage

After installation, you will find an item "Export Multiple Images" in the plugin section of the title menu in the editor. Simply click on it. The usage is similar to the built-in image export feature of the software.

## Notes

The exported images contain the logos of "siyuan" and "ccds" (Chuancheng Design), which are located in the plugin source code (`data\plugins\modemkiller\source\index.js`) at line 31. You can modify the plugin source code to remove them if desired.

This plugin uses source code distribution. You are free to modify its code to create a new plugin or for any other purpose, as long as you comply with the AGPL 3.0 or later license.

PS:The name of the "modemkiller" plugin originates from an inside joke from the early days of the internet in China. At that time, modems were nicknamed "cats" in Chinese due to the similarity in pronunciation. When a webpage contained many images, loading all of them could take a long time due to the slow speed of modems. Therefore, people would warn that "many images kill the cat". This plugin can  export multiple images, so I named it "modemkiller"。

PPS：Due to the browser's caching mechanism, you may need to "clear cache and hard refresh" each time after updating the plugin to load the latest plugin code (I know this is troublesome for you, but it's simpler for me to write it this way XDD).
